// Ported directly from lbp/frontend/src/ui.tsx (RESOURCES_CATEGORIES,
// QUIZ_SECTIONS, QUIZ_QUESTIONS, QUIZ_STRENGTH_COPY, QUIZ_DISCUSS_COPY,
// QUIZ_PROMPTS, computeQuizResults - traced directly from the real file,
// not re-authored) as of Sept 2026. This is real, already-reviewed product
// copy (see the master brief's note that the 26 quiz questions were written
// specifically for this feature and are meant to go live as-is), so it is
// copied verbatim rather than paraphrased.
//
// Deliberately English-only, matching the website's own current state: the
// master brief explicitly notes "Content is English-only for now... this
// section isn't translated to ru/es yet" and the same for the quiz. So,
// unlike every other screen in this app, nothing here goes through
// src/i18n/t() - that would be translating content the real site itself
// doesn't yet translate, which could drift out of sync with it. If/when the
// website adds ru/es copy for this section, port that here the same way.
